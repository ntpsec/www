== GitLab.com is our forge  ==

We use GitLab.com as our forge.

Our GitLab.com group is at https://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec

Please use the issue tracker and the pull request process at that
GitLab.com group.  The issue tracker makes helps us not drop
anything, and the merge requests ensure your work is properly
credited to you.

== GitHub.com is a mirror, not our forge ==

We maintain a public mirror of the repo at https://github.com/ntpsec/ntpsec

Please do not use GitHub issues or GitHub pull requests.

== Hacking guide ==

Please read and obey the https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec/blob/master/devel/hacking.adoc[devel/hacking.adoc] file.

== License of contributions ==

Annoying but necessary legalese:

    By submitting patches to this project, you agree to allow them to be
    redistributed under the project's license according to the normal
    forms and usages of the open-source community.

The license of new code is to be BSD-2-clause. The license for new
documentation is to be Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
Contributions and patches with no license information will be assumed
to be under these licenses.

Please do *not* submit code under GPL or other licenses which place
conditions on derived works; we cannot accept such code.  Please avoid
submitting code under any license other than BSD-2-clause, and avoid
submitting docs under any license other than the Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 License.

It is your responsibility to make sure you have all the necessary
rights to contribute to the project.

== Development Practice ==

Before starting significant work, please propose it and discuss it
first in the mailto:devel@ntpsec.org[devel@ntpsec.org] mailing list.  Other people may
have suggestions, will want to collaborate, and will wish to review
your code.

Please work on one piece of conceptual work at a time.  Keep each
narrative of work each in a different branch.

As much as possible, have each patch solve one problem.

A patch needs to comfortably fit in a reviewer's head.

A patch must not leave the project in a non-functional state.

== Optional: Send patches by email ==

If you are unable to use GitLab.com pull requests, we welcome simple
fix and "drive by" patches submitted by email.

Create the patch with git format-patch against the tip of master of
the main public repo.

You can email your patch to mailto:devel@ntpsec.org[devel@ntpsec.org] if you are a
member of that mailing list, or you can email your patch to
mailto:contact@ntpsec.org[contact@ntpsec.org] if you are not.

When we merge in your patch we will use the git parameter ---author
with the contents of the From header from your email and the git
parameter --date with the contents of the Date header from your email.
So make sure your From header is correct.

For complex contributions, please use GitLab.com.
