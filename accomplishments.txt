= What we've accomplished =

We have extracted the NTP codebase from BitKeeper::

This was not a trivial achievement.  One of our team members has
more experience doing messy repository conversions than anyone else
alive, including gnarly and venerable projects like groff and Emacs.
Producing a really high-quality conversion took him *ten weeks* of
concentrated effort.  You can read more about
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6792[how to spot a high-quality repository
conversion]; our NTP history has all the traits of good ones.

We have significantly hardened the code against buffer overruns::

To prevent buffer overruns, we have replaced all unsafe string
functions (strcpy/strcat/strtok/sprintf/vsprintf/gets) with safe
versions that take a buffer bound.

We have removed a hundred sixty thousand lines of obsolete code::

Less code means less attack surface.  Here are some things we've found
to remove:
+
|==============================================================================
|  45.0 KLOC (20%)   | In-tree copy of libevent2
|  28.5 KLOC (13%)   | Undocumented, deprecated, obsolete, or broken refclocks
|  24.0 KLOC (11%)   | Unused ISC library code
|  12.5 KLOC (5%)    | libopts/autogen removal
|  10.0 KLOC (4%)    | Removal of legacy Windows code
|   9.0 KLOC (4%)    | Code obsolete because we assume a POSIX.1-2001/C99 base
|   9.0 KLOC (4%)    | Removal of ntpdc
|   3.0 KLOC (1%)    | Move of sntp/ntpdig to Python
|   2.0 KLOC (1%)    | Replacement of ntpdate by a shell wrapper around ntpdig
|   4.0 KLOC (1%)    | Removal of Autokey.
|   7.0 KLOC (3%)    | Replacement of C ntpq in Python
|  12.0 KLOC (3%)    | Miscellaneous cruft
| 169.0 KLOC (71%)   | _Total removed_
|  62.0 KLOC (27%)   | _Total remaining_
| 231.0 KLOC (100%)  | _Total at conversion time_
|==============================================================================
+
(Totals will not sum exactly due to rounding errors and replacement of
some old, unreliable crypto code by a newer and slightly bulkier
implementation.  Numbers generated using
https://gitlab.com/esr/loccount[loccount].)
+
These removals include most of the bulk of ntpd, the most
security-critical code.  And the numbers understate the size of the
removals slightly because the way we counted "remaining" code includes
some test code and features added since the repository conversion.

We have improved the accuracy of time stepping with real hardware by x10::

When NTP was originally written, computer clocks only delivered
microsecond precision.  Now they deliver nanosecond precision (though
not all of that precision is accurate).  By changing some internal
representations we have made NTPsec able to use the full precision of
modern clocks, which results in a factor 10 or more of accuracy
improvement with real hardware such as GPSDOs and dedicated time
radios.

We have implemented a simpler refclock configuration syntax::

The ntp.conf configuration syntax for declaring local reference
clocks was notoriously odd and opaque. While we continue to support
it for backward compatibility, we have implemented and documented
a simpler and more comprehensible syntax. No more magic 127.127.t.u
address or numeric driver types!

We have added a statistics-file visualizer to help diagnose problems::

Tuning the configuration of a time server is a subtle and sometimes
tricky process. The causes of problems can range from misconfiguration
through power outages to bad network weather and beyond.  NTP keeps
logs of operating statistics that can be very helpful - if you know
how to interpret them. NTPsec supplies a visualization tool that makes
those numbers into graphs so you can (literally) see what's going on.

We have applied Coverity scanning and fixed bugs where they were revealed::

NTP Classic had occasionally been Coverity-checked in the past, but
those warnings were not systematically fixed.  We found 40 unresolved
defect reports and dealt with them appropriately.

We have fixed all compiler warnings::

All compiler warnings have been either fixed or suppressed for
principled reasons (like "that one is caused by a known GCC optimizer
bug"). This may seem like a small thing, but it can have a significant
effect on maintainability and downstream defect rates.  Noise warnings
are a kind of undergrowth in which real warnings and the bugs that
trigger them can lurk undetected.

We have increased the visibility of potential defects to static analyzers::

By well-defined transformations of the code, including improving its
type discipline, we can give static analyzers and verification tools
better traction to find defects and potential vulnerabilities.  We've
got a good running start on this already, changing the code to use C99
bools wherever possible and safe.

We have moved the build to waf::

The NTP Classic build system was 31,000 lines of impacted autotools
cruft, a Lovecraftian nightmare of complexity that reached out from
sunken R'lyeh to trouble the dreams of the living.  We switched to
https://waf.io/[waf], an alternative single-phase build system also
used (among other places) by the Samba project.  Our builds got
an order of magnitude faster, and the new build recipe is about
1 KLOC!

We have updated and reorganized the documentation::

The NTP in-tree documentation was in terrible shape - incomplete where
it was not actively misleading, with some parts of it that needed
updating (such as the WHERE-TO-START file) actually unmodified
since 1998.  It had a serious problem with different documents telling
different stories.  We've fixed all that; every command-line switch
and every configuration entity now has a single point of truth, also
the manual pages and Web documentation are generated from the same
master files.  Archaisms have been removed and much has been updated.

We have reduced the set of languages used in the suite to C and Python::

The code we inherited used way too many languages - there were scripts
lurking in Perl, awk, and S.  By discarding or replacing this stuff we
have increased its maintainability, leaving fewer dark corners for
bugs to lurk in. All the scripting we install is now Python, creating
opportunities for code reuse across programs that didn't exist before.

We have earned trust in the InfoSec research community::

NTPSec was the first NTP implementation to respond to and develop a
fix for CVE-2015-7704, the KoD off-path attack bug that achieved
http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/new-attacks-on-network-time-protocol-can-defeat-https-and-create-chaos/[news
coverage in _Ars Technica_] and elsewhere in October 2015.  Even
before we first shipped code we participated in the mitigation and
disclosure process on over a dozen CVEs, and developed good working
relationships with some key players in the security community.  They
have already learned to trust us to respond rapidly and effectively to
vulnerability reports.

We have achieved measurable gains in security::

Since early 2016 and our 0.1 release it has become routine that, in
public disclosures of batches of CVEs against NTP Classic, around
75% fail to affect NTPsec at all because we had pre-hardened the
code or removed the relevant attack surface.
