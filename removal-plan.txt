= Feature removals =

The aim of the NTPsec project is high security, availability, and assurance.
The more code we can throw away, the fewer potential vulnerabilities
and complexity issues we will have.

Accordingly, we have already removed many obsolete features, and have
a schedule of more feature removals planned.  If something on this
list is important to you, tell us.  If the complexity cost of keeping
it is low, you win.  If the complexity cost is high, then we will need
a donation of engineering time or money to support keeping it in the
codebase.

== Removals already complete ==

The Autokey public-key-based authentication system feature has been
removed.  It has been reported to have been broken for some time, and
added a significant amount of complexity.

Autokey-like functionality will be provided by implementing
the "Network Time Security" protocol, soon after the IETF advances
draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-NN,
draft-ietf-ntp-cms-for-nts-message-NN, and
draft-ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp-NN
to full RFC status.

The ntpdc utility has been entirely removed.  (All its capabilities are
available through ntpq with a similar user unterface.)  Support for
Mode 7 packets in ntpd has been removed along with it, significantly
reducing total attack surface and code complexity.

The ntpsnmpd daemon, being half-complete and not fully conformant with
RFC 5907, has been removed.  In a future release we would be open to
replacing it with a conformant implementation.

The long-deprecated ntpdate program has been replaced with a shell
wrapper around ntpdig.

We have removed the following refclock drivers, which were either
broken and won't compile on modern systems (12, 21), or irretrievably
obsolete due to the WWVB modulation change (3, 19, 32, 34, 36), or had
unfixable Y2K issues (37), or unfixable security issues (16, 39, 43,
45), or relied on hardware interfaces no longer found on modern
systems (6, 7, 35), or were deprecated in NTP Classic and had their
documentation removed (13, 14, 17), or duplicate support in other
dribers (38) or were EOLed more than 20 years ago without aftermarket
activity or Web chatter in a decade, or we have been advised by their
maintainers should go (27).

|==============================================================

In addition, support for WWVB and OMEGA has been removed from
the Type 5 (TrueTime) driver. Support for GPS and GOES has been retained.

You may be unable to build NTPsec on a sufficiently archaic big-iron
Unix platform.  Support for the native APIs of any version that last
shipped in the last century has been removed. The codebase assumes
full POSIX.1-2001 and C99 conformance including ANSI pthreads; in some
cases you may be able to meet this requirement by upgrading to a
modern GCC- or clang-based toolchain.

Platform-dependent kernel-space code that raised potential security
issues has been removed.  No programs access /dev/kmem directly any
longer, and STREAMS support for the parse driver has been deleted.

Support for VMS has been removed, and is unlikely to be restored
unless that platform has achieved effectively full standards
conformance and someone interested throws engineering time and money
at us.  Likewise for VxWorks.

== Suppressed code ==

While we have not removed the Windows code, we will not ship with
Windows supported until that platform has an active port maintainer.

== Obsolete refclocks ==

We consider a refclock driver obsolete if it fails any of the
following tests:

1. It has been discontinued for seven or more years and cannot be
   found for sale on the Web. Types 5, 9, 10, 26, 27, 35, 37, 41.

2. Duplicates capabilities of GPSD, which specializes in GPSes.
   Types 20, 29, 30, 31.

3. Accuracy an order of magnitude worse than a cheap 1PPS GPS. Type 33.

Thus, we plan to remove the following refclock drivers:

|==========================================================
|Type 5: TrueTime GPS/GOES Receivers (TRUETIME)
|Type 9: Magnavox MX4200 GPS Receiver (GPS_MX4200)
|Type 20: Generic NMEA GPS Receiver (NMEA)
|Type 29: Trimble Navigation Palisade GPS (GPS_PALISADE)
|Type 30: Motorola UT Oncore GPS (GPS_ONCORE)
|Type 31: Rockwell Jupiter GPS (GPS_JUPITER)
|Type 33: Dumb Clock (DUMBCLOCK)
|Type 41: TrueTime 560 IRIG-B Decoder (REFCLK_TT560)
|==========================================================

We also plan to remove the following modes in the Type 8 (PARSE) driver.
These are for equipment that has not been available at least since
2003, and probably earlier.

|==========================================================
|Mode  3: ELV DCF7000
|Mode  4: Walter Schmid DCF receiver Kit
|Mode  9: Trimble SVeeSix GPS Receiver TAIP Protocol
|Mode 10: Trimble SVeeSix GPS Receiver
|==========================================================

This will leave the following drivers in place:

|==========================================================
|Type 1: Undisciplined Local Clock
|Type 4: Spectracom GPS Receivers (SPECTRACOM)
|Type 8: Generic Reference Driver (PARSE)
|Type 11: Arbiter 1088A/B GPS Receiver (GPS_ARBITER)
|Type 18: NIST/USNO/PTB Modem Time Services (ACTS_MODEM)
|Type 22: PPS Clock Discipline (PPS)
|Type 26: Hewlett Packard 58503A GPS Receiver (GPS_HP)
|Type 28: Shared Memory Driver (SHM)
|Type 40: JJY Receivers (JJY)
|Type 42: Zyfer GPStarplus Receiver
|Type 44: NeoClock4X - DCF77 / TDF serial line
|Type 46: GPSD NG client protocol
|==========================================================
