== Invitation to Responsible Security Researchers ==

We specifically invite and welcome the scrutiny and participation of
responsible security researchers.  Please, inspect the code, abuse the
APIs, fuzz the sockets, and attack the network traffic.

If you are a security research organization, we invite you to contact
us even before you have anything to report, so we can set up a working
relationship, and exchange keys.

== Reporting Vulnerabilities ==

Please report discovered vulnerabiltites to the mailto:security@ntpsec.org[
NTPsec security team].

This team email forwards to a very small cadre of the internal NTPsec
staff.

You may GPG encrypt your report. Our GPG key can be found on the well
known keyservers, and has the following id and fingerprint:

== Our Responsiveness Goals  ==

Our goal is to ack receipt within 24 hours; verify each potential
vulnerability within 3 days; and if the vulnerability is a significant
network risk, such as remote execution, denial of service, network
amplification, or corruption of time reporting, develop a fix within 7
days.

Our experience so far is that we are much faster than that.

== Our Responsible Disclosure Policy ==

Our responsible disclosue policy is very closely modeled on the
https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm[CERT
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy]:

Vulnerabilities reported to the mailto:security@ntpsec.org[NTPsec
security team] will be disclosed to the public 45 days after the initial
report, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or
workarounds from affected vendors. Extenuating circumstances, such as
active exploitation, threats of an especially serious (or trivial)
nature, or situations that require changes to an established standard
may result in earlier or later disclosure. Disclosures made by the
NTPsec security team/CC will include credit to the reporter unless
otherwise requested by the reporter. We will apprise any affected
vendors of our publication plans and negotiate alternate publication
schedules with the affected vendors when required.

It is the goal of this policy to balance the need of the public to be
informed of security vulnerabilities with vendors' need for time to
respond effectively. The final determination of a publication schedule
will be based on the best interests of the community overall.

Vulnerabilities reported to us will be forwarded to the affected vendors
as soon as practical after we receive the report. The name and contact
information of the reporter will be forwarded to the affected vendors
unless otherwise requested by the reporter. We will advise the reporter
of significant changes in the status of any vulnerability he or she
reported to the extent possible without revealing information provided
to us in confidence.
